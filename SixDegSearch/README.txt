Six Degree Search program which consults XOWA to find Wikipedia articles based upon a user input text
file.  Articles can be selected using check boxes after the XOWA query--these articles are then going
to serve as input to the ElementScraper program.

This program and all associated files were originally written by Mary Fatima Menges. Currently, none of the
files have been modified from the first version.

The files are to eventually be updated into one program by the project team.
