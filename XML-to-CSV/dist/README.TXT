This jar will prompt the user for two paths, an input path to a folder of xml files
that were generated by the Stanford CoreNLP, and an output path to a folder where the
user wants to store the CSV output of the program.

The CSV output files can be used to import Nodes into a Neo4j database.

The author is currently rewriting certain methods in the files contained 
in the src folder to increase readability/efficiency. Additionally new methods are
being constructed to create CSV files to import relationships into the database.
