This folder contains the text paragraphs of the "Barack Obama" wikipedia page. Some
of the paragraphs will not be needed for our future reference and data imports--at the bottom of most
Wikipedia articles there are references and other links that are nonsense to the 
CoreNLP. Notes and Reference paragraphs are from P128 and on.

Each paragraph was run through the CoreNLP and the resulting output is in the xml_paragraphs folder.

We used the files in the xml_paragraphs folder to create several CSV files that can be used to import
nodes into a Neo4j database.
