The Element Scraper takes the articles that were produced by the Six Degree Search and breaks them into 
paragraphs small enough to be analyzed by the CoreNLP.

This program and all associated files were originally written by Mary Fatima Menges. Currently, none of the
files have been modified from the first version.

The files are to eventually be updated into one program by the project team.
